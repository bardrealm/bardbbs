# Welcome to BardBBS!
## Prepare thine ears for the sound of modems SCREEEEing in the distance...

BardBBS is a simple BBS, or Bulletin Board System, that allows you to play some classic text mode Door Games with your fellow bards! 

### How do I get into the server? 
Right now, BardBBS is limited to subscribers only while we're gauging interest. If enough folks are interested, we'll move BardBBS to a dedicated host with more resources to support everyone! 

For details on how to connect to BardBBS, head on over to the [Connect Page](/bardbbs-web/connect) for more info!
